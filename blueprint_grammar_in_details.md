# Service Blueprint Overview
  The term "blueprint" used in the CSM context means the combination of a ***Functional Model*** and one or more ***Deployment Models*** which collectively define the software and various deployment options to deliver requested functionality to the user. This can range from something as simple as a server with an OS to a complicated multi-tier business application.
